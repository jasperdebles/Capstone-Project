# Capstone Project
 This is the final assignment for the course Advanced Business and Economic Forecasting, part of the MSc. Economics curriculum at UNC Charlotte.

 The first part starts off with plotting timeseries of economic and financial data and making them stationary by taking logs and differences respectively. Next, AR(1) and ADL(1,4) models are estimated and tested for significance , and used to make forecasts. Finally, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the two models is compared.
