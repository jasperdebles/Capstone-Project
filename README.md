# Capstone Project
 This is the final assignment for the course Advanced Business and Economic Forecasting, part of the MSc. Economics curriculum at UNC Charlotte.

 The first part starts off with plotting timeseries of economic and financial data and making them stationary by taking logs and differences respectively. Next, AR(1) and ADL(1,4) models are estimated and tested for significance , and used to make forecasts. Finally, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the two models is compared.

The second part is making a timeseries of the Swedish GDP that displays a seasonal pattern. Then, a forecast is made with a linear trend model and a seasonally adjsuted model.

The third assignment is making the timeseries for crude oil by taking logs, differences, and annualize the data. The best ARIMA model is found by looking at the ACF and PACF, and the BIC and AIC. Ultimately, an ARIMA(3,1,1) is chosen.

The fourth assignment is from Stock & Watson's Introduction to Econometrics. The excess return of the stock seems stationary and this is confirmed by the ADF test.
